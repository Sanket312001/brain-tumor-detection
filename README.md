Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning
This project leverages Keras, TensorFlow, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build a robust deep learning model that can detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images. The model classifies input images into one of the following categories:

1. Glioma Tumor
2. Meningioma Tumor
3. Pituitary Tumor
4. No Tumor

Key Features

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes state-of-the-art CNN architectures for high precision and recall.
Custom Dataset Handling: Preprocesses MRI images (resizing, normalization, and augmentation) to optimize model performance.
Scalable Framework: Built on TensorFlow and Keras for easy scalability and transferability.
